Vector Magnet Simulation Toolkit
================================

This toolkit provides MATLAB scripts and classes for simulating, analyzing,
and visualizing the magnetic fields generated by a three-axis vector
magnet, as described in:


Contents
--------

- Bobbin.m
  Class defining the geometry, winding parameters, and magnetic field 
  calculations for a superconducting coil (bobbin).

- VectorMagnet.m
  Class defining a full three-axis vector magnet composed of three bobbins. 
  Supports field calculations at arbitrary 3D coordinates and across planes.

- vector_magnet_field_calculator.m
  Main script to define the vector magnet configuration and evaluate its 
  magnetic field performance through various numerical experiments.


Main Features
-------------

- Coil definitions (designed, effective, or optimized parameters)
- Magnetic field calculation at arbitrary positions
- Parametric sweep of bobbin geometry (e.g., outer radius)
- 1D nanopositioner position sweep
- 2D magnetic field maps and 3D visualizations


Requirements
------------

- MATLAB R2023a or newer


How to Use
----------

1. Open the `vector_magnet_field_calculator.m` script in MATLAB.
2. Choose a bobbin configuration by uncommenting the relevant definitions.
3. Run the script to:
   - Display bobbin properties
   - Compute magnetic fields at fixed or scanned positions
   - Visualize fields in 2D and 3D
4. Modify current, geometry, or scan ranges and planes as needed for custom studies.
