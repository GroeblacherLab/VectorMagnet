# VectorMagnet
Repository of the design files and simulation code for a vector magnet developed in the GroeblacherLab at Delft University of Technology.

This folder currently contains:
  - Design files
  - Scripts for Vector Magnet Simulation Toolkit

These files are part of a publication on how to build and simulate a vector magnet:

We are an academic research group and we would like to share our work with everyone out there who also wants to build their own vector magnet. We hope that our designs and code will find applications in many areas beyond quantum physics. The only thing we ask in return is to be acknowledged for our contribution (hence we use the GNU GPLv3 license) and hope that using our designs and code helps others to save precious time. Please let us know if you find bugs, if you added new features or have other ideas for improvments and feel free to share our repository with anyone you think would like to use it. If you're interested in the work we do, please visit https://www.groeblacherlab.org

If you find our code useful and use it, please cite as described in the CITATION.cff file.
